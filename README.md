# web_frontend_testing

I prepared this test in IntelliJ IDEA using single class.
To make it work you need:
Java jdk, jre, chromedriver, selenium java webdriver, junit.
The best way to execute it is import whole package into IntelliJ and run code.

Also the best way to execute this is just copy the code from Check.java file to your test env.
To make it work junit, selenium webdriver etc..need to be imported.
